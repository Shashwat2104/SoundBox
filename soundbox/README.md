## üîÑ Collaborative Workflow

SoundBox automatically checks for new tracks every 5 seconds, so there's no need to refresh the page. When someone adds a new track, you'll see a notification and the track will appear in your mixer.

## üß™ Example Session

Here's how a typical collaborative session might flow:

1. A guitarist creates a Jam Room and records a chord progression
2. They share the room link with a bassist and drummer
3. The bassist joins and adds a bassline while listening to the guitar
4. The drummer adds a beat that complements both tracks
5. All musicians can adjust the mix to their preference
6. The final collaboration is exported and shared
